We are a global, non-confrontational climate action group.

<section class="top-cta" src='/template-signup.html'></section>

At Carbon Warriors we commit to fight climate change by:

 - Trying to make purchases from businesses that are actively working to reduce emissions.

 - Avoiding busineesses and organisations that refuse to reduce or offset their emissions.

 - Supporting politicians who vote in favour of legislative action to reduce global CO<sub>2</sub>

 - Making effort to reduce our own CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.

 Are you with us? Sign up today to join a global movement that aims to plant 1 billion trees for carbon offsetting.
